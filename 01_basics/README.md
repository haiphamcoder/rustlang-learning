# 🌟 01_basics

This folder contains introductory examples and exercises for learning the basics of Rust programming. Each subfolder covers a specific fundamental topic, complete with a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src/main.rs` file to demonstrate the concepts.

## 📂 Subfolders Overview

### 1. **⚙️ control_flow**
   - Demonstrates the control flow mechanisms in Rust, such as:
     - 🔄 `if`, `else if`, and `else`
     - 🎯 `match` statements
     - 🔁 Loops: `for`, `while`, and `loop`
   - Learn how to control the execution of your program effectively.

### 2. **📊 data_types**
   - Covers Rust's data types, including:
     - 🔢 Scalar types: `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, and `char`
     - 🧩 Compound types: `tuples` and `arrays`
   - Explore type inference and explicit type annotations in Rust.

### 3. **🔧 functions**
   - Focuses on defining and using functions in Rust:
     - 📝 How to declare functions
     - 📥 Function parameters and return values
     - 🧩 The importance of expressions and statements
   - Understand how to modularize your code with functions.

### 4. **📦 variables**
   - Explains variables and mutability in Rust:
     - 📌 `let` bindings
     - 🔒 Immutable vs mutable variables
     - ✨ Shadowing variables
   - Master how Rust enforces safety and ownership through variables.

## 🚀 How to Run the Examples

1. Navigate to the subfolder you want to explore, for example:
   ```bash
   cd control_flow
   ```
2. Build and run the example using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
